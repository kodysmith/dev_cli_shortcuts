# dev_cli_shortcuts
this is a repository of cli shortcuts that I find to be handy.


Installation:
run install.sh;

from the terminal:
command:
./install.sh;



This will install all of the commands in the general folder. 
Yyou should not have to move them around, or delete anything to cleanup later.
Just clean up your .profile or .bash_profile file if you want to remove them.
